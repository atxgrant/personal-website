A personal website and blog about AI tools in product management. No frameworks, no build step, no nonsense — just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## What's here

Short posts sharing honest, field-tested takes on AI tools — what actually works in product management and what doesn't. No hot takes, no hype. Just a PM's experiment notes.
